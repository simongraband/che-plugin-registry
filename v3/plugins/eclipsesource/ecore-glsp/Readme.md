# Ecore-GLSP Editor

This is the registration for the Ecore-GLSP Editor as a Theia Extension for che. 

## Open points: 
* Currently the Plugin is configured against my personal docker hub account - this needs to be changed.
* The Plugin may be polished to integrate che better. For reference see also the [che-theia](https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia). E.g. A given project is not cloned by Ecore-glsp.
* The Docker Build is based on node-alpine. Maybe some packages (e.g. Git) are interesting to be added to the container.
